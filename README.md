# bieberscore

Analyzing lyrical complexity, a toy example for learning clojure. The full background story can be found in this blog post:

<http://dirkgorissen.com/blog/....>

This is a toy example so don't complain that the scoring algorithm does not work in case x or y. It's not meant to be fool proof.

Pull requests welcome :)

## Usage

The code should be well documented and rather self explanatory. The main function at the bottom should be easy enough to understand and modify.

The code should work as is but you should request your own API key from LastFm (which is free) and use that instead.
